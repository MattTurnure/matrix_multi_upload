		<h2>Using Matrix Multi-Upload</h2>

		<p>Matrix Multi-Upload lets you upload a batch of files to a Matrix field at once, right from the Publish page.</p>
		<p>To use it, go to the Publish page of the entry you wish to upload images for. A new accessory tab will appear at the bottom of the page labeled “Matrix Multi-Upload”. Click on it.</p>
		<p>Choose which Upload Directory you wish to upload files to. Then choose which Matrix field you want the images to get attached to (and which File column, if there’s more than one).</p>
		<p>Finally, click the “Add Files” button to select which files you wish to upload, and then click “Start Upload”. Matrix Multi-Upload will then send each of your files to the server. As they finish, new rows will be created in your Matrix field, with the File column automatically filled in with the new file.</p>
